# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project uses **supervised machine learning algorithms** to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their petal and sepal measurements.

The classification models used include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
